# Weather Data ETL Pipeline with Airflow and PostgreSQL

## Overview

This project is a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches weather data for European capitals from the OpenWeatherMap API, stores the data in a PostgreSQL database, and uses Apache Airflow to orchestrate the data loading process. The project also includes a temperature heatmap visualization.
